# Defect Handling System

The bot includes a comprehensive system for recording manufacturing defects across different material types.

## Defect Types

The system handles defects for four material types:
- **Panel Defects**: Damaged or irregular panels of different thicknesses (0.5mm or 0.8mm)
- **Film Defects**: Issues with coating films of various colors/codes
- **Joint Defects**: Problems with different joint types (Butterfly, Simple, Closing)
- **Glue Defects**: Tracking of defective adhesive materials

## Defect Workflow

The defect handling process is defined in [handlers/production.py](mdc:handlers/production.py):

1. User selects "ðŸš« Ð‘Ñ€Ð°Ðº" (Defect) from the production menu
2. System prompts for defect type using the `ProductionStates.waiting_for_defect_type` state
3. Based on material selected, system follows a specific workflow:
   - For panels: Request thickness â†’ quantity
   - For films: Request film color â†’ meters
   - For joints: Request joint type â†’ color â†’ thickness â†’ quantity
   - For glue: Request quantity directly

## Implementation Details

- `handle_defect`: Main entry point for defect processing
- Material-specific handlers:
  - `handle_panel_defect`: Processes panel defects
  - `handle_film_defect`: Processes film defects
  - `handle_joint_defect`: Processes joint defects
  - `handle_glue_defect`: Processes glue defects
- Each defect record is stored in the database with an operation_type indicating defect source
- Inventory is automatically adjusted when defects are recorded
