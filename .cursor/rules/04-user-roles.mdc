# User Role System

The bot implements a role-based access control system to manage different permissions and workflows.

## Available Roles

Defined in [models.py](mdc:models.py) through the `UserRole` enum:

- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Complete access to all bot functions
- **SALES_MANAGER**: Access to order creation and management
- **WAREHOUSE**: Access to inventory and material management
- **PRODUCTION**: Access to manufacturing processes and defect recording
- **NONE**: Default role for unassigned users

## Role-based Navigation

Each role has access to different menu systems:

- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Can access all menus and switch between roles
- **SALES_MANAGER**: Can only access sales-related functions
- **WAREHOUSE**: Can only access warehouse and inventory functions
- **PRODUCTION**: Can only access manufacturing functions

## Access Control

The system implements access control through checker functions:

- `check_production_access`: Ensures only production staff or admins can access production features
- Similar checkers exist for warehouse and sales functions

## Role Assignment

Roles are assigned by super administrators through the admin menu, with actions stored in the database.
