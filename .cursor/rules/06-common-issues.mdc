# Common Issues and Troubleshooting

This guide covers frequent issues and their solutions in the bot system.

## State Handling Issues

### Issue: Buttons Not Working in Defect Menu

When buttons don't respond in the defect type selection menu:
- Check if proper handlers exist for all defect types in [handlers/production.py](mdc:handlers/production.py)
- Ensure state transitions are correctly set up for `ProductionStates.waiting_for_defect_type`
- Look for state mismatch between expected and actual states (may be formatted as "production_states:waiting_for_defect_type")

### Issue: State Persistence Problems

If the bot seems to be in the wrong state:
- The `debug_defect_type_handler` provides fallback handling for defect type selection
- Use logging to check current state with `current_state = await state.get_state()`
- Verify appropriate error handling for all states

## Database Issues

### Issue: Missing Materials

When materials don't appear in selection menus:
- Check if the materials were properly added to the database
- Ensure database connection is working with `db = next(get_db())`
- Verify queries are properly formatted for material retrieval

### Issue: Inventory Discrepancies

If inventory counts seem incorrect:
- Review Operation records to trace all transactions
- Check for any missing transaction records in operations with `is_defect` flag
- Ensure all handlers properly update inventory counts

## Menu Navigation

### Issue: Incorrect Menu Displayed

If the wrong menu is shown after an operation:
- Check `MENU_NAVIGATION` definitions in [navigation.py](mdc:navigation.py)
- Verify the state is properly set after each operation
- Ensure `get_menu_keyboard` is called with the correct MenuState
