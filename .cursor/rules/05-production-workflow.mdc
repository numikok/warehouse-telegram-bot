# Production Workflow System

The production module manages the manufacturing process from raw materials to finished products.

## Main Production Flows

All production workflows are implemented in [handlers/production.py](mdc:handlers/production.py):

### 1. Material Intake

- **Panels**: Record incoming panels with specific thickness (0.5mm or 0.8mm)
- **Films**: Register new film rolls with color code, quantity, and measurements
- **Joints**: Add joints with type (Butterfly, Simple, Closing), color, and thickness
- **Glue**: Record adhesive inventory increases

### 2. Manufacturing Process

The `handle_production` function manages the main production process:

1. Select panel thickness for manufacturing
2. Choose film color/code to be applied
3. Specify production quantity
4. System calculates material requirements and updates inventory

### 3. Defect Handling

As detailed in the defect handling rule, the system records different types of defects and adjusts inventory accordingly.

### 4. Order Management

The production system handles manufacturing orders from the sales department:
- View pending orders
- Mark orders as completed
- Update inventory based on fulfilled orders

## Inventory Tracking

Each material operation (income, consumption, defect) is recorded in the Operations table with:
- User who performed the action
- Operation type
- Quantity
- Detailed JSON with operation specifics
