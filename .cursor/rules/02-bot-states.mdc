# Bot States and Navigation

The bot operates on a finite state machine (FSM) model to handle different workflows.

## Menu States

[navigation.py](mdc:navigation.py) defines the menu structure through the `MenuState` enum:

- Main menus for each role (SUPER_ADMIN_MAIN, SALES_MAIN, WAREHOUSE_MAIN, PRODUCTION_MAIN)
- Production submenus (PRODUCTION_MATERIALS, PRODUCTION_DEFECT, PRODUCTION_PROCESS, PRODUCTION_ORDERS)
- Warehouse submenus (WAREHOUSE_STOCK, WAREHOUSE_ORDERS, WAREHOUSE_INCOME, WAREHOUSE_MATERIALS)
- Sales submenus (SALES_ORDER, SALES_STOCK, SALES_HISTORY, SALES_CREATE_ORDER, SALES_ORDER_CONFIRM)
- Admin submenus (SUPER_ADMIN_USERS, SUPER_ADMIN_REPORTS, etc.)

## Process States

[states.py](mdc:states.py) defines detailed process states for each operation:

### Production States
- Material handling states (waiting_for_panel_thickness, waiting_for_film_code, etc.)
- Production process states (waiting_for_production_panel_thickness, etc.)
- Defect handling states (waiting_for_defect_type, waiting_for_defect_panel_thickness, etc.)
- Order management states

### Other Process States
- Order states for creating and processing customer orders
- Warehouse states for managing inventory
- Sales states for managing customer relationships

## Navigation Flow

1. User selects a main menu based on their role
2. Based on selected option, the bot transitions to appropriate submenu
3. Each process has a sequence of states to collect required information
4. Back buttons allow navigation to previous menus
5. Process completion returns to the appropriate menu
